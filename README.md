# formula1-season-explorer

This app provides dashboards for F1 enthusiasts ([App link](https://formula1-season-explorer.streamlit.app/)). You can view statistics and race winner predictions for the upcoming Grand Prix.

※ This README serves as a personal reference for hobby development purposes. It is primarily intended for use when revisiting or updating the project. It is not designed to instruct or guide a general audience.

## Environment Setup

Install the required packages with the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Application Architecture

This application provides statistics and race winner predictions for the weekend Grand Prix.

- Downloads past results from my AWS S3 bucket.
  - The AWS S3 data source is updated every Monday via a batch process managed by an AWS Lambda function ([repository](https://github.com/YoshimatsuSaito/formula1-basic-info-saver)).
- Creates an in-memory database using DuckDB.
- Generates useful plots to help understand each Grand Prix's features.
- Predicts race winners using a simple LightGBM model.
  - The model is trained on historical data from the 2006 to 2022 seasons, using a [notebook](./notebooks/create_model.ipynb). The trained model is stored in an S3 bucket.
  - The app generates prediction features using the latest data, and the pre-trained model uses these features to predict future race outcomes.

## TODO

- Modify statistics to allow comparison of results from different grid positions across multiple Grand Prix.
- Analyze and display each driver's recent form.
